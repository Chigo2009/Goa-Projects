        <h1>Whitr owl</h1>
        <p>The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus),[4] also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl,[5] is a large, white owl of the true owl family.[6] Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra.[2] It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.[7] One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage.[6] Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown.[8] Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls.[9]: 48 

            Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime.[7] The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding efforts and global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling lemmings, but in the non-breeding season, and occasionally during breeding, the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available prey – most often other small mammals and northerly water birds, as well as, opportunistically, carrion.[5][8] Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra.[10] The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered.[8] Despite the short Arctic summer, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn.[7]
            
            The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable.[8] A largely migratory bird, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably irrupting to the south in large numbers.[8][11] Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in-depth knowledge historically about the snowy owl's status. However, recent data suggests the species is declining precipitously.[2][12] Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals, recent data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less.[2][13] While the causes are not well understood, numerous, complex environmental factors often correlated with global warming are probably at the forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl's existence.[2][8]
            
            Taxonomy
            The snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Strix scandiaca.[14] The genus name Bubo is Latin for "horned owl" and scandiacus is Neo-Latin for "of Scandinavia".[15] The former generic name Nyctea is derived from Greek meaning "night".[5] Linnaeus originally described the different plumages of this owl as separate species, with the male specimens of snowy owls being considered Strix scandiaca and the likely females considered as Strix nyctea.[5][16] Until recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo and the species is now thusly often considered inclusive with that genus.[17][18] However, some authorities debate this classification, still preferring Nyctea. Often authorities are motivated to retain the separate genus on the grounds of osteological distinctions.[5][19]</p>
            <h2>Linux</h2>
            <p>Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)[15] is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[17][18][19] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.[20]

                Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[21][22] Thousands of distributions exist, many based directly or indirectly on other distributions;[23][24] popular Linux distributions[25][26][27] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu, while commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and ChromeOS. Linux distributions are frequently used in server platforms.[28][29] Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make up a distribution may include a display server (windowing system), a package manager, a bootloader and a Unix shell.
                
                Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. While originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system,[30] and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations, mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers.[g] When combined with Android, which is Linux-based and designed for smartphones, they have the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.</p>

                <p>იმერეთი — დასავლეთ საქართველოს ერთ-ერთი ისტორიულ-გეოგრაფიულ მხარე, ამჟამად იმერეთის მხარის ნაწილი. ვრცელი მნიშვნელობით იგი დასავლეთ საქართველოს ისტორიული სახელწოდებაა, ისევე როგორც ძველი კოლხეთი, ეგრისი, აფხაზეთი.

                    საკუთრივ იმერეთი შემოსაზღვრულია აღმოსავლეთით შავი ზღვით დასავლეთით ცხენისწყლით, ჩრდილოეთით კავკასიონის ქედით და სამხრეთით ფერსათის, ანუ მესხეთის მთებით. სახელწოდება დაკავშირებულია ამ მხარის მდებარეობასთან, იმერეთი, ანუ ლიხსიქითა მხარე.
                    
                    იმერეთი იყოფა ორ ნაწილად: ქვემო და ზემო იმერეთად. იმერეთის ტერიტორიაზე აღმოჩენილი არქეოლოგიური ძეგლები ადასტურებს, რომ ამ მხარეში ადამიანს ცხოვრება, ჯერ კიდევ, ქვედა პალეოლითის ხანაში დაუწყია. მათ შორისაა საკაჟიის მღვიმე და ჭახათის (მდ. წყალწითელას ნაპირზე), დევისხვრელის (მდ. ჩხერიმელას ნაპირზე) გამოქვაბულები, სათაფლიის მიდამოები და სხვა. საქალაქო ცხოვრების უძველესი პერიოდის არქეოლოგიური ძეგლები ნაპოვნია ქუთაისში, ვანში, ვარციხეში (როდოპოლისი), შორაპანში და სხვა. მხარის ხელსაყრელი გეოგრაფიული მდებარეობის გამო ამ ქალაქებს ოდითგანვე დიდი სტრატეგიული, ეკონომიკური და პოლიტიკური მნიშვნელობა ჰქონდა.</p>
                    <h2>Masha and the Bear</h2>
                    <p>Masha and the Bear (Russian: Ма́ша и Медве́дь, romanized: Másha i Medvéd', pronounced [ˈmaʂə ɪ mʲɪdˈvʲetʲ]) is a Russian preschool comedy animated television series created by Oleg Kuzovkov and produced by Animaccord Animation Studio, loosely based on the oral children's folk story of the same name. The series focuses on the adventures of a very young girl named Masha and a bear (whom she dubs "Mishka"), her caring friend who always keeps her safe from disasters.

                        Masha and The Bear is the most watched preschool series in the world, with 36 times more requests than the average. It is also the fifth most-watched youth series (0–18) worldwide, just ahead of Peppa Pig.[1][better source needed]
                        
                        Many of the episodes have been successful on YouTube. In particular, the original Russian-language version of the episode "Recipe for Disaster" (Russian: Маша плюс каша, romanized: Masha plyus kasha) has almost 4.5 billion views as of April 2022, making it the site's fourteenth most viewed video of all time, and the most viewed video on YouTube that is not a music video.[2]
                        
                        The show was first launched on January 7, 2009, and it was the first Russian-produced animated TV show to be released in 4K.[citation needed]
                        
                        The show provides the basis for the Masha and The Bear Land of Laughter, an area with attractions aimed at younger children at the theme park Land of Legends, near Antalya, Turkey.[3]</p>

    <h1>My favorite color is Red and Black</h1>
    <h2>Red</h2>
    <p>Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625â€“740 nanometres.[1] It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.[2]</p>
    <h2>Black</h2>
    <p>Black is a color[2] that results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and grey.[3] It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness.[4] Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.[4]</p>

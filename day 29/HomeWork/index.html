            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a
                powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly
                vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only
                two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

                Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and
                mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf
                forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on
                ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending
                these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females
                with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for
                about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their
                own.

                Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are
                locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali.
                Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of
                Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major
                threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and
                the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife
                conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is
                legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans,
                anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife
                corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is planned.

                The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity
                since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger
                featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and
                has continued to appear in culture worldwide.
